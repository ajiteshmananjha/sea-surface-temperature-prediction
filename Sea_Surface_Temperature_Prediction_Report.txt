Project Report: Sea Surface Temperature Prediction

Introduction
The project aimed to predict sea surface temperatures using historical data. The process involved data analysis, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. The initial approach considered using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) due to the sequential nature of the data, but later shifted to a Random Forest Regressor, which provided better performance.

Data Analysis
The project began with a thorough analysis of the dataset. Key steps included:
1. Dataset Examination: Understanding the structure of the dataset, including the number of columns and rows.
2. Null Value Check: Identifying and handling missing values to ensure the model's accuracy.
3. Data Sorting: Organizing the data by date to maintain the sequential nature.

Feature Selection
A correlation matrix was generated to assess the relationships between different features. This helped in identifying the most relevant features for model training.

Data Splitting
The dataset was divided into training and testing sets:
- Training Set: 80% of the data
- Testing Set: 20% of the data
This split ensured that the model was tested on fresh data, providing a realistic measure of its accuracy.

Data Scaling and Normalization
Selected features were scaled and normalized to standardize the data, making the training process more efficient.

Model Selection and Training

Initial Model: LSTM
Given the sequential nature of the data, an LSTM model was initially chosen. Key steps included:
- Experimenting with batch sizes, epochs, and different optimizers.
- Despite efforts, the model achieved an RMSE of around 2, which was not satisfactory for accurate sea surface temperature prediction.

Revised Approach: Random Forest Regressor
Recognizing the simplicity of the dataset and the uniformity in the correlation values of features (excluding air temperature), the focus shifted to a Random Forest Regressor from scikit-learn. Steps included:
- Reapplying data modifications.
- Training the Random Forest model.

Model Evaluation
The Random Forest Regressor delivered significantly better results:
- RMSE: 0.31
- RÂ² Score: 0.98
These metrics indicated a high level of accuracy and reliability in the model's predictions.

Conclusion
The project successfully predicted sea surface temperatures using a Random Forest Regressor. The transition from LSTM to Random Forest was driven by the need for a more appropriate model for the dataset's characteristics. The final model demonstrated excellent performance, with minimal error and high explanatory power.

Future Work
Further improvements could include:
- Exploring additional features or external datasets to enhance prediction accuracy.
- Implementing advanced techniques for handling any remaining data nuances.
- Conducting cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness.
This project showcases the importance of flexibility in model selection and the effectiveness of Random Forest Regressor for regression tasks involving historical data.
